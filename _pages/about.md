Hello and welcome! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Systems and Information Engineering at the University of Virginia. I work in the Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) Lab and Link Lab under the advisement of Prof. Nicola Bezzo. Before joining the AMR Lab, I obtained my B.S. in Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in 2017.

Currently my research focuses on robot motion planning and navigation under uncertainty, including robot social navigation in the presence of humans and other dynamic actors, fault-tolerant control and planning, and resilient and coordinated planning of multi-agent autonomous vehicles. Through my work, I have cultivated experience in machine learning, explainable artificial intelligence, model predictive control (MPC), optimal control, computer vision, and using ROS platforms including ground and aerial vehicles. Check out our lab website to see what my colleagues are working on and what types of robots we work with on a regular basis!'

Outside of work, I'm a huge NBA fan and love to do crossword puzzles regularly.
